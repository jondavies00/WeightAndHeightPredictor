Jonathan Davies' Logistic Regression Classifier

To use, run the 'Predictor.py' file. It will automatically load the dataset and fit a model to the data using gradient descent and the cross entropy loss function.
The best accuracy I have found is around 92%, which is on par with a model from the sklearn module.
